# video-datetime-stamp
Render a date/time stamp into videos using ffmpeg

Render tdate time stamps to videos with ffmpeg is annoying.
This node js command line is an easement to do this job.


This command creates an output file at c:/git/video-datetime-stamp/test.stamped.mp4  
```node ./bin/render-stamp.js file c:/git/video-datetime-stamp/test.mp4```
